The majority of goods that travel between countries are still transported on container ships. However, many companies are developing autonomous container ships that do not require a human crew to control them. Crewless cargo ships have three important advantages over crewed vessels.", "First, crewless cargo ships would reduce labor costs for shipping companies. Paying the human crew of an ocean-going vessel is one of the largest expenses during a voyage. On top of their salaries, the owner of the ship also has to provide them with food, sleeping quarters, climate control, and entertainment. Removing the crew from container ships would eliminate all of those costs.", "Second, crewless ships would be less attractive targets for pirates. While the goods on a container ship are valuable, pirates usually make their money by ransoming the crew of the ship. Removing the crew would immediately make pirates less likely to attack a ship. In addition, ships with no crew can be designed to make them difficult to board, the cargo can be made nearly inaccessible, and the ships would have no manual controls for the pirates to use.", "Third, crewless ships would be less likely to have accidents. Most accidents that occur at sea are caused by human error. When a ship encounters an emergency situation, the human crew often reacts too slowly or makes mistakes. Crewless ships could use sensors and computers to detect and react to similar situations in a fraction of a second. That would allow them to alter their course much more rapidly and avoid accidents."], "narrator": ["Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about."], "lecture_text": ["Professor", "Although companies are developing ships that can operate without a human crew, it seems unlikely that they will ever be completely autonomous. The arguments in the reading that support crewless ships are largely the result of misplaced optimism and ignorance about the capabilities of autonomous systems.", "First, costs: It\u2019s hardly fair to describe the crew as nothing more than a cost for the company. Although most ships already operate with the minimum number of crew members required, the crew are still very necessary to the proper operation of the ship. They maintain the ship by inspecting it for wear and damage, and they make repairs while they are sailing. On a crewless ship\u2014those problems would remain unrepaired until the ship reached its destination, and leaving broken equipment unrepaired could cause a lot more damage. So, having people on board the ship at all times can actually save the company money.", "Second, pirates: the measures mentioned in the reading would make the ships less attractive to low-tech pirates, but there are also high-tech pirates. Hackers can access the ship's data files to learn what it is carrying, and then compromise the autonomous systems like GPS to make the ship crash. Or they could take control of the guidance system and control the ship completely. That would allow them to send the ship to any location they choose. Then they could take their time removing the supposedly \u201cinaccessible\u201d cargo.", "Third, accidents at sea: The problem with container ships is not that their crew members react slowly, but that the ships take so long to change course. Container ships are among the largest ships in the world, and once they get moving in one direction, it is difficult to stop them or change their course. Sure, a computer could detect and react to emergencies like rocks or icebergs. But most of the other ships at sea are controlled by people, which makes them much less predictable.
