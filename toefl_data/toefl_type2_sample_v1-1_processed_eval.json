I feel this way because as far as I think, the way we are treating the non-renewable resources is in such a way that we would definitly see a drastic increase in the air pollution. I am going to explain few reasons why I mostly disagree with the statement. Firstly, the ways for transportation or construction or many such things are well accustomed with using non-renewable resources such as petrol and deisel. If we are to shift them to the renewable energy sourced machinery or technology, it would be so difficult and very cost effective. For instance, I have a relative who recently bought a car which costs around 12 lakhs and runs on petrol. I asked him a week ago that would he buy an electric one as it is nore environment friendly. He replied that he bought this car with his life savings and he can't afford to buy or exchange another one any sooner. Second thing is that we believe that making cars and everything else electric and make them running on batteries is really environment friendly. But what we do not focus on is that in manufacturing those batteries, they use Lithium. To mine Lithium, we will have to take so many parameters as it is not good for nature as well as humans. It actually pollutes air within its surroundings of mining. There was a news saying that two villages had to evacuvate their villages as Lithium mining would start. They evacuated in order to not get effected by that readiation that Lithium mining emits. I hereby summarise this opinion by saying that in the coming 20 years there won't be any less pollution than we have today. The pollutants may change but pollution will remain the same or incline. All we have to try and do is try to make use of pollutants to make something that could be useful such as recycled water bottles. Until unless we find ways to clear up atleast some of the pollution in the air, we won't see any decline in the pollution."}]}, {"id": 123, "question": "I feel this way because as far as I think, the way we are treating the non-renewable resources is in such a way that we would definitly see a drastic increase in the air pollution.", "target": "I feel this way because as far as I think, from the way we are treating non-renewable resources, we would definitely see a drastic increase in air pollution.", "answers": "I feel this way because as far as I think, from the way we are treating non-renewable resources, we would definitely see a drastic increase in air pollution.", "ctxs": [{"title": "idea_suggestions", "text": "Agree: International agreements to reduce pollution e.g. the Paris Climate Accords Electric cars Better public transportation Disagree: Carbon emissions higher than ever Rapidly industrializing countries Alternative energy not that clean"}, {"title": "model_answer_text", "text": "Many people are hopeful that there will be less air pollution in 20 years than there is today.
