When solar panels were first developed, it was obvious that they were a better source of energy than fossil fuels. Sunlight is free and using it to create electricity generates far less pollution than burning fossil fuels. Unfortunately, solar panels were very expensive to produce, and they weren\u2019t very efficient. Today, solar panels are inexpensive, durable, and generate much more energy than ever before. As more people, companies, and cities switch over to solar energy and other renewable energy sources, the amount of air pollution from fossil fuels will decrease. Second, I am confident that air pollution will be reduced because I have already seen it happen in my hometown. When I was young, the city had very bad air pollution. The city is in a valley, and during the winter there was often a brown cloud of pollution hanging over it. On days like that, the news would give air pollution warnings and call it a red day. The city government and companies worked together to reduce the amount of air pollution, and they have been very successful. Over the last few years, there have been very few red days even though the population of the city continues to grow. In conclusion, I believe that there will be much less air pollution 20 years from now.

Second thing is that we believe that making cars and everything else electric and make them running on batteries is really environment friendly.
