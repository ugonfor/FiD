I agree with the second group because many short vacations allow the students to enjoy different activities during their breaks, and they make preparation easier for teachers.

Long vacations are usually in the summer, so the students can enjoy hot-weather activities like swimming and going to amusement parks, but different seasons offer different opportunities.

I feel this way for two reasons that I will examine in this essay. First of all, in long vacations you can live in you home for a long period of time. And for students who live in other countries or should say that whose house are far are unable to visit their home beause the vacation are small. It takes a lot of time in travelling. So if we say that we have small vacations, consequently, it will be really hard to pay visit to home. This is best demonstrated by my personal experience. My college is kind of far from my home. So it takes me a minimum of two days of travelling. Which means if I have a week-off,  4 days will be wasted in travelling. As a result, I will not be able to go home and will stay at my college hostel. But if a had a long vacation, I would definetly have visited my home. Second of all, long vacations do not get you distracted from your studies. You know that you need not to pack and unpack again and again. You have to do this only once in a year so it keeps you calm and you only think about your studies. Evidently, it also saves you time of travelling back and forth from home. For instance, I am an engineering student and have to really focus on my studies and can not travel many times in a year. Once I did trave quiet a few times a year. It really disturbed my schedule and as a result, it was evident in my score card that it was not a good idea. In conclusion, I will say that I prefer a long vacation than several short vacations for two reasons. First, because students who live far from their home are not able to visit their parents.

For instance, I am an engineering student and have to really focus on my studies and can not travel many times in a year. Once I did trave quiet a few times a year. It really disturbed my schedule and as a result, it was evident in my score card that it was not a good idea.

If the school year was broken up by four vacations in the middle of each season, then they could do many more things. For example, they could go hiking in the spring, pick apples in the fall, or go on long skiing trips in the winter. Closing schools for the summer makes sense for many reasons, but many short vacations would be more enjoyable for the students. Second, many short vacations during the year would benefit the teachers by making their preparation easier. My friend is a high school teacher, and she has often told me about how much pressure a single long vacation puts on her. She has to plan an entire school year's worth of lessons before the first day of classes. That is a huge amount of work, and it is quite difficult. It also limits her ability to adjust her lessons when the situation demands it. If the school year was broken up by four vacations during the year, teachers would be able to plan lessons for each session during the breaks. This would spread out their workload throughout the year and give them less stress. In conclusion, I believe that many short vacations during the school year are better than one long vacation.

Firstly, i believe continuous studies with no breaks can decrease the efficiency of the student and increase frustration levels. Regular breaks at frequent intervals can help the brain to relax and this can improve energy levels, efficiency and productivity. Vacations can help students feel relaxed and they can start the next semester with a fresh mind. Also, i think that smaller breaks could be something that they can look forward to after every semester ends. This will motivate the students to work hard for the exams and then take a trip as a reward for all the hardwork. Secondly, sometimes students want to spend their vacation with their family and not necessarily the vacation days and parent's work leaves coincide.

She has to plan an entire school year's worth of lessons before the first day of classes. That is a huge amount of work, and it is quite difficult. It also limits her ability to adjust her lessons when the situation demands it. If the school year was broken up by four vacations during the year, teachers would be able to plan lessons for each session during the breaks. This would spread out their workload throughout the year and give them less stress. In conclusion, I believe that many short vacations during the school year are better than one long vacation. I think this because many short vacations would allow students to enjoy a greater variety of activities and they would make lesson preparation easier and less stressful for teachers."}, {"title": "question", "text": "Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year.

Firstly, i believe continuous studies with no breaks can decrease the efficiency of the student and increase frustration levels. Regular breaks at frequent intervals can help the brain to relax and this can improve energy levels, efficiency and productivity. Vacations can help students feel relaxed and they can start the next semester with a fresh mind. Also, i think that smaller breaks could be something that they can look forward to after every semester ends. This will motivate the students to work hard for the exams and then take a trip as a reward for all the hardwork. Secondly, sometimes students want to spend their vacation with their family and not necessarily the vacation days and parent's work leaves coincide. For example, I remember a time when i had summer holidays in school and wanted to plan an abroad trip with my family but my father was working on some important project and he could not afford work leave during that time. I ended up spending my time in the same city and eventually got bored. The main point is to get a break, not necessarily a long break. Short breaks also work. In this way, they can plan their yearly trips or get togethers with family and friends well in advance."}]}, {"id": 72, "question": "Many people are hopeful that there will be less air pollution in 20 years than there is today.

Personally, I believe that in the future our world will have less air pollution than it has today. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explain in the following essay. To begin with, during the last few decades, there has been an immense amount of scientific discoveries in every part of branches including in climate change and air pollution. For example, oil-fuelled cars, which are the main contributors of air pollution are being replaced by electric vehicles in the last few years and this is becoming a trend in all over the world. Electric vehicles spread almost no particles that pollute air, as a result, if they completely replace our current way of transportations, we will have much clearer air, free from dangerous particles that are spread from exhaust of oil-fuelled cars, in the future. My personal experience is also a compelling illustration of this. I live in a big city, where many people use their cars to get to places. Living with asthma in such circumtances have made my life very difficult, as I had to breathe dangerous air particles that are spread from cars everyday. However, now that more and more people use electric vehicles compared to past, the air is getting cleaner and my health condition is also getting better. Furthermore, nowadays people are making fewer children and this is causing a population decline. A significant amount of air pollution is caused by human activities. In 20 years, it is assumed that, especially in aging countries such as Germany and Japan, there will be fewer humans on our plants than today. For instance, none of my peers want to have children either because of financial difficulties or cultural change. Children require both a massive amount of financial stability and free time. In the past, people used to have kids just because it was the norm. However, it is getting more common in today's adults to not have any children. They are aware that it is a big responsibility. The more educated people get it is less likely that they have children. As getting an education is getting more accessible by everyone, this will lead to people having less children, hence a population decline. In conclusion, I strongly feel that the world will be clearer in the future."}]}, {"id": 86, "question": "Personally, I believe that in the future our world will have less air pollution than it has today.

Electric vehicles spread almost no particles that pollute air, as a result, if they completely replace our current way of transportations, we will have much clearer air, free from dangerous particles that are spread from exhaust of oil-fuelled cars, in the future. My personal experience is also a compelling illustration of this. I live in a big city, where many people use their cars to get to places. Living with asthma in such circumtances have made my life very difficult, as I had to breathe dangerous air particles that are spread from cars everyday. However, now that more and more people use electric vehicles compared to past, the air is getting cleaner and my health condition is also getting better. Furthermore, nowadays people are making fewer children and this is causing a population decline. A significant amount of air pollution is caused by human activities. In 20 years, it is assumed that, especially in aging countries such as Germany and Japan, there will be fewer humans on our plants than today. For instance, none of my peers want to have children either because of financial difficulties or cultural change. Children require both a massive amount of financial stability and free time. In the past, people used to have kids just because it was the norm. However, it is getting more common in today's adults to not have any children. They are aware that it is a big responsibility. The more educated people get it is less likely that they have children. As getting an education is getting more accessible by everyone, this will lead to people having less children, hence a population decline. In conclusion, I strongly feel that the world will be clearer in the future."}]}, {"id": 87, "question": "To begin with, during the last few decades, there has been an immense amount of scientific discoveries in every part of branches including in climate change and air pollution.", "target": "To begin with, during the last few decades, there has been an immense amount of scientific discoveries made in every sector including climate change and air pollution.", "answers": "To begin with, during the last few decades, there has been an immense amount of scientific discoveries made in every sector including climate change and air pollution.", "ctxs": [{"title": "idea_suggestions", "text": "Agree: International agreements to reduce pollution e.g. the Paris Climate Accords Electric cars Better public transportation Disagree: Carbon emissions higher than ever Rapidly industrializing countries Alternative energy not that clean"}, {"title": "model_answer_text", "text": "Many people are hopeful that there will be less air pollution in 20 years than there is today.
